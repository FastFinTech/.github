# Services

- **Cloud applications**

  Architect / build / modernize scalable cloud applications with [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

  Build scalable distributed applications with [Microsoft Orleans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/orleans/ "Orleans home page")

  Continuous integration / deployment with Github actions and Azure pipelines.

  Container and container orchestration technology such as Docker and Kubernetes.

- **Data feeds**

  Architect / build / modernize data feeds with extremely high throughput, redundancy, scaleability, seamless fail-over and intermittent connection handling. My data feeds are faster and their domain model makes your application code simpler.

  Knowledge of FIX protocol.

- **API Wrappers**

  Need to connect your application to a *horrible* api? I build api wrappers that return domain-driven models producing state-change events that dramatically simplify your application code.

- **Trading platforms**

  __*User Expererience*__ With 20 years experience as a trader and coder, I understand how a trader wants to operate their trading platform to make instrument selection, order entry/modification and position management extremely quick and easy.

  __*Developer Experience*__ I architect trading platform code to make it easy to read, easy to maintain, and super fast as well. I understand market data and the position/order/execution domain models and requirements of a trading platform, particularly for a trader who needs to move fast and design active responses to executions and execution failures.

  Indicator and trading strategy development. Backtesting. Particularly with [NinjaTrader 8](https://ninjatrader.com/) and with years of experience making backtests reflect realistic live market performance.

  Familiarity with US and International Equity, Fixed Income and Commodity markets

  Understanding of post-trade lifecycle
  
- **Domain-driven design with CQRS and EventSourcing**

  I enjoy this style of application development, particularly when paired with Microsoft Orleans and [EventStore](https://www.eventstore.com/)

# Education
 - B Eng (First Class Hons) Aerospace Avionics, minor in Systems Engineering
 - 20 years at university of Google, StackOverflow and Github, solving c# programming challenges and reading code written by people much smarter than me :)
    
# Career
 - 2019 - Present: **Adventure Dad**
 
   I left day to day work at Apex Investing when my son was born to enjoy life with family as a dad. Residual income from Apex Investing has and continues to support this lifestyle. 

  - 2011 - 2019: **Cofounder and CTO, [Apex Investing](https://apexinvesting.com/)**

    The very short story of Apex is that we started by bringing our own trading systems to the market. Traders using our systems began to request that we perform research tasks that led to the creation of new and better tools, leading to creation of better trading strategies as we listened to and served our customers. After ten years of very intense work we had systems that practically eliminated the need for traders to make discretionary decisions (and corresponding mistakes). Then we provided funding for our traders, removing the last of the obstacles to their success. [Apex Trader Funding](https://apextraderfunding.com), only two years old, has paid out over USD 8 million to our traders in September 2023 alone and has paid out more to their traders than any other futures funded trading program in the industry, EVER.

    My role as CTO had me overseeing the development of the trading systems software we used. This was C# code written mostly for NinjaTrader 7 and then NinjaTrader 8, plus our backend hosted systems supporting business activities and trading support data.

    Apex went through a period of trading derivatives at [Nadex](https://nadex.com) and we built our own trading platform to meet our traders' exact needs for a much faster data feed and custom user interface with advanced order creation/handling.

  - 2002 - 2010: **Derivatives, Futures, and Forex trader**

    Traded equities, equity options, futures, and forex using day trading / swing trading techniques.

    Wrote software to facilitate backtesting, indicator and strategy creation and order entry using C# and NinjaTrader 6 and 7. Other traders began to buy software I had written, and this led to creation of Apex Investing in 2011.

    Built a SAAS stock screener service using full-stack .Net web technology plus jQuery and licenced that for use for over ten years by [Wealth Mentors Pte Ltd](https://www.wealthcreationmentors.com/).

    Built a replacement trading platform for [Tradency](https://www.tradency.com/) to facilitate my own trading activity with faster/more convenient order entry/modification features before they released their own `Mirror Trader` platform.

  - 2000 - 2001: **Systems Engineer, Cooperative Research Center for Satellite Systems**

    Built an Operations Control Console (OCC) for an experimental satellite using Visual Basic 6. It connected to hardware at various ground stations over the internet.

    Debugged software onboard the satellite and in the groundstation using Ada.

  - 2001 - 2001: **Systems Engineer, Australian National University**

    Built a helicopter flight control system using ANSI C

  - 1996 - 2000: **Soldier, Australian Army**

  # Other interests / hobbies

  - Sailing - my family likes to liveaboard our sailboat, having coastal adventures.
  - Flying of all kinds, particularly unpowered - I like to compete in cross-country gliding competitiions.
  - Adventure sports - kitesurfing, trekking, freediving, etc. This was for personal enjoyment, but now it's all about leading the children in the joy life.
  - Psychology, leadership, psycho-spiritual growth. I need to mature to be a better leader for people who depend on me, especially my family.
  - Meditation and other mindfulness practises.
  - Most importantly - being a dad and learning how to create the best possible outcomes for my children.
