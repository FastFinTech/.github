Playground for a semi-retired FinTech developer and adventure dad. *Update:* Currently looking for a full-time project for the next couple of years. Please email [bboyle1234@gmail.com](mailto:bboyle1234@gmail.com) or text +61490797637 to contact me.

Services I provide: 

- **Cloud applications**

  Architect / build / modernize scalable cloud applications with [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

  Build scalable distributed applications with [Microsoft Orleans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/orleans/ "Orleans home page")

  Continuous integration / deployment with Github actions and Azure pipelines.

  Container and container orchestration technology such as Docker and Kubernetes.

- **Data feeds**

  Architect / build / modernize data feeds with extremely high throughput, redundancy, scaleability, seamless fail-over and intermittent connection handling. My data feeds are faster and their domain model makes your application code simpler.

  Knowledge of FIX protocol.

- **API Wrappers**

  Need to connect your application to a *horrible* api? I build api wrappers that return domain-driven models producing state-change events that dramatically simplify your application code.

- **Trading platforms**

  __*User Expererience*__ With 20 years experience as a trader and coder, I understand how a trader wants to operate their trading platform to make instrument selection, order entry/modification and position management extremely quick and easy.

  __*Developer Experience*__ I architect trading platform code to make it easy to read, easy to maintain, and super fast as well. I understand market data and the position/order/execution domain models and requirements of a trading platform, particularly for a trader who needs to move fast and design active responses to executions and execution failures.

  Indicator and trading strategy development. Backtesting. Particularly with [NinjaTrader 8](https://ninjatrader.com/) and with years of experience making backtests reflect realistic live market performance.

  Familiarity with US and International Equity, Fixed Income and Commodity markets

  Understanding of post-trade lifecycle
  
- **Domain-driven design with CQRS and EventSourcing**

  My preferred style of application development, particularly when paired with Microsoft Orleans and [EventStore](https://www.eventstore.com/)
