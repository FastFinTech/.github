Playground for a semi-retired FinTech developer and adventure dad.

Services I provide: 

- **Cloud applications**

  Architect / build / modernize scalable cloud applications with [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

  Build scalable distributed applications with [Microsoft Orleans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/orleans/ "Orleans home page")

- **Data feeds**

  Architect / build / modernize data feeds with extremely high throughput, redundancy, scaleability, seamless fail-over and intermittent connection handling.

- **API Wrappers**

  Need to connect your application to a *horrible* api? I build api wrappers that return a readonly domain-driven model producing state change events that dramatically simplify your application code.

- **Trading platforms**

  With 20 years experience as a trader and coder, I understand how a trader wants to operate their trading platform to make instrument selection, order entry/modification and position management extremely quick and easy. I know exactly how to architect the code to make it easy to read, easy to maintain, and super fast as well.
